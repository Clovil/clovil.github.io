Summary: Why do I use GitHub pages?

## Why do I choose to use GitHub pages?

[GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/)

> Websites for you and your projects
Hosted directly from your GitHub repository. Just edit, push, and your changes are live

From the opening of the GitHub pages, tt seems a good match to my needs. It could also serve as a good practice to host an online resume, or an online portfolio showcase site. It is limited to **one** site per GitHub account/organization, which is making its purpose to be leaning towards resume/portfolio 1-pager.

## What is GitHub pages?

GitHub pages is a static site that takes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files straight directly from a repository on GitHub, optionally runs the files through a build process, and publishes a website.

To publish a user site, user needs to create a repository that is named `<username>.github.io`. Well at this time, that is all I know.
