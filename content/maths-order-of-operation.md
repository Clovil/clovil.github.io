## Maths order of operations

PEMDAS

"Operations" in maths mean things like add, subtract, multiply, divide, squaring, etc. If it isn't a number it is probably an operation.


Order of operations 

- Do things in Parentheses first
- Exponents (Powers, Roots) before Multiply, Divide, Add or Substract 
- Multiply or Divide before Add or Subtract
- Otherwise just go left to right 

How you should remember this?

- P Parentheses first 
- E Exponents (Power and Square Roots, etc.)
- MD Multiplication and Division (left to right)
- AS Addition and Subtraction (left to right)

Different regions might have their own saying

- GEMS (Grouping, Exponents, Multiply or Divide, Add or Subtract)
- In the UK they say BODMAS (Brackets, Orders, Divide, Multiply, Add, Subtract)
- In Canada they say BEDMAS (Brackets, Exponents, Divide, Multiply, Add, Subtract)


In general, Python follows the PEMDAS rule when deciding the order of operations.
