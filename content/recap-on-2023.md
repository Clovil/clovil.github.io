## Things you remembered doing in 2023


There are some events that were pretty memorable in 2023 such as:


- Stayed in Guiyang where Fani took a test for her teaching certification. It was also a place where she could've gone for university in the past. Too bad she did not choose to go to Guiyang University
- Going to Macau to see Wang YiBo
- It was my first time going to Japan. We also visited the university where Fani studied in Kagoshima, Japan


We will also be welcoming 2024 in an area called [XiTang](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E8%A5%BF%E5%A1%98%E5%8F%A4%E9%95%87/4873126?fr=ge_ala). It's an ancient man-made town that was newly created. 



Cheers! See you on the next post.
